    "# Understanding UMF: Unity Molecular Formula for Ceramic Glazes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to calculate the **Unity Molecular Formula (UMF)** for ceramic glazes, step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is UMF?\n",
    "\n",
    "UMF is a way of expressing glaze chemistry where **flux oxide moles are normalized to sum to 1.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: we're normalizing **moles** (molecular amounts), not weight. This matters because different oxides have very different molecular weights - 100 grams of silica contains far more molecules than 100 grams of lead oxide.\n",
    "\n",
    "By expressing everything in moles relative to a unity of flux, we can:\n",
    "- Compare glazes regardless of batch size\n",
    "- Substitute materials while maintaining chemistry\n",
    "- Predict glaze behavior from the numbers"

    "## Oxide Roles in Glass Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Oxides play different roles in forming a glaze. These categories are guidelines, not rigid rules - some oxides behave differently depending on temperature, concentration, and what else is in the glaze.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Formers\n",
    "These create the glass structure itself:\n",
    "- **SiO₂** - The primary glass former. Forms the silica tetrahedra network.\n",
    "- **P₂O₅** - Glass former, creates opalescence in some glazes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Modifiers (Fluxes)\n",
    "These break up the silica network, lowering the melting point:\n",
    "- **R₂O (alkalis)**: Li₂O, Na₂O, K₂O - Very strong fluxes, high thermal expansion\n",
    "- **RO (alkaline earths)**: CaO, MgO, BaO, SrO - Moderate fluxes, add durability\n",
    "- **Other RO**: ZnO, PbO, MnO - Various fluxing behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediates / Amphoteric\n",
    "These can act as either network formers or modifiers depending on context:\n",
    "- **Al₂O₃** - Primary stabilizer. Increases viscosity, prevents running, improves durability.\n",
    "- **TiO₂** - Can act as network former or modifier. Promotes crystallization.\n",
    "- **Fe₂O₃** - Colorant, but in high amounts also acts as a flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It's Complicated\n",
    "- **B₂O₃** - Boron is weird. It forms its own glass network, acts as a strong flux at low temperatures, behaves differently at high temperatures, and its thermal expansion contribution is non-linear. Depending on your glaze and firing temp, you might count it as a flux, as a glass former, or track it separately. There's no single right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Unity Convention\n",
    "In UMF, we choose which oxides to normalize to 1.0. **This choice is yours** - pick the oxides that make sense for understanding YOUR glaze. The traditional approach uses R₂O + RO fluxes, but you might include or exclude oxides based on their actual behavior in your specific glaze."
